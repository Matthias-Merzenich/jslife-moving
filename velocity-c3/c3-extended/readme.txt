This is a collection of Life objects related to c/3 spaceships and puffers.
It demonstrates the state of c/3 technology as of 20 November 2002.

This contains c/3 spaceships of various periods, c/3 puffers of various
periods, useful reactions using c/3 spaceships, and some sawtooths based
on c/3 spaceships.

The latest version of this collection can be obtained at my web site at:
	http://canb.auug.org.au/~dbell

The objects in this collection may be freely distributed and repackaged.
However, please attempt to maintain the credits for the discoverers and
the dates of the objects.

Some objects have earlier (and therefore larger and obsolete) versions
which are no longer in the collection.  However in many cases the original
version of these objects have been kept.  Comparing the old and new versions
gives some insight on how the technology has improved.

Note that there are many more c/3 spaceships known than are shown in
this collection.  The collection only contains some historical spaceships
from the earliest days when their numbers were small, those spaceships
which can be useful in building other objects, representatives of the
various periods, and some interesting constructions using c/3 technology.

If you want to see lots of small c/3 (and other speed) spaceships,
you can, for example, visit Stephen Silver's web site at:

Important objects in this collection are:

	. Period 3 c/3 spaceships which can perturb objects without
	  destroying themselves.  These are extremely important for
	  constructing high period rakes.

	. Period 3 c/3 convoys which can duplicate or turn gliders.
	  This means that if any high period c/3 puffer is found which
	  either produces a forward glider or can be perturbed to produce
	  a forward glider, then it can theoretically be cleaned up to
	  produce a clean rake.

	. Easy methods for constructing c/3 spaceships having an
	  arbitrarily high period.

	. A method to construct c/3 rakes of any possible period (e.g.,
	  any multiple of three) starting around period 333.
