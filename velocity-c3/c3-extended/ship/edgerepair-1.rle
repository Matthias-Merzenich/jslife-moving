#C A small c/3 period 3 ship with a self-repairing component.
#C The left edge of this spaceship can sometimes interact with other objects
#C to perturb them, and then repair the damage to itself to preserve the ship.
#C This can be used to perturb c/3 spaceships and puffers to modify their output,
#C like the edge-spark spaceships can.  This is the smallest of a series of
#C edge-repair spaceships having the same active edge.
#C David I. Bell, July 1997
