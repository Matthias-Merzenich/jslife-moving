This archive is a collection of 2c/5 puffers and related objects found in
Conway's Game of Life.  They are the result of running incomplete 2c/5
spaceships for a number of generations and examining the results.
Most times the reaction at the trailing edge either overtakes the front,
destroying the ship, or fizzles out to leave a shorter base period ship.
However, every so often the reaction settles down, resulting in a puffer
or a higher period spaceship.  This archive contains those results and
derivatives that were created by perturbing them.

The files are in RLE format and should be readable by most Life viewing
programs.  Each file is named according to the type and period of the
object(s) it contains (e.g. s020 contains period-20 spaceships, p045 
contains period-45 puffers).  Files beginning with 'var' contain
puffers or rakes whose period can be adjusted by altering the relative
position or phase of the components.

Enjoy.
